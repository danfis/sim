\section dev_messaging_overview General Overview
Messaging is one method how \ref sim::Component "Components" can comunicate
with each other or how to notify Components from outside.

\ref sim::Component "Component" class has virtual method
\ref sim::Component::processMessage "processMessage()" (which can be
overloaded in child classes) that process all
\ref sim::Message "Messages" delivered by simulator.
Each Message is defined by its type and any Component can be registered for
receiving Messages with some type.

Each Component has assign level of priority and so have each Message.
Priority is defined in 5 levels (lowest, lower, normal, higher, highest).
Messages are delivered to Components (through method
\ref sim::Component::processMessage "processMessage()") in order from
highest to lowest priority. First are delivered all Messages to Components
with highest priority then to higher and so on, and first are delivered
Messages with highest priority then with higher and so on.


\section dev_messaging_impl Implementation
Whole messaging algorithm is implmented in
\ref sim::SimComponentMessageRegistry "SimComponentMessageRegistry" class.

Implementation can be divided into 3 logical operations:
- \ref dev_messaging_impl_reg "Component registration to message type"
- \ref dev_messaging_impl_assign "Assigning message to registered Components"
- \ref dev_messaging_impl_deliver "Delivering all assigned Messages to Component"

\subsection dev_messaging_impl_reg Component registration
Each \ref sim::Message "Message" is defined by its type (which is
accessible, for example, by static member ::Type). Any
\ref sim::Component "Component" can be registered to recieve any type of
Messages. Type of Message is simply one unsigned long number and number of
different types can be very much and number can be determined during
compilation - so registration must be dynamic and it should be fast. This
leads to use some sort of hash table for mapping between message type
(unsigned long) to list of Components.

Standard library has already implemented this type of container called
<a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/map">std::map</a>. Type of
message (unsigned long) is key of std::map and value must be list of
Components. This list can't contain duplicate references to Component which
leads to checking whole list everytime Component is registered. List must
be searched during unregistering of Component. Because of this all, also
std::map is used for implementation of list of Components.

So for message type -> Component mapping is used:
\code
std::map<unsigned long, std::map<sim::Component *, sim::Component *> *>
\endcode
See types
\ref sim::SimComponentMessageRegistry::_list_t
\ref sim::SimComponentMessageRegistry::_map_t
and member
\ref sim::SimComponentMessageRegistry::_map.

\ref sim::SimComponentMessageRegistry "SimComponentMessageRegistry" class
has these methods operating with mapping:
- \ref sim::SimComponentMessageRegistry::regComponent "regComponent()" -
registers given Component to message type. Complexity is
\f$O(log(N) + log(M))\f$, where \f$N\f$ is number of all registered types
and \f$M\f$ is number of Components registered to specified message type.
- \ref sim::SimComponentMessageRegistry::unregComponent "unregComponent()" -
unregisters given Component from specified message type. Complexity is same
as regComponent().
- \ref sim::SimComponentMessageRegistry::unregComponentFromAll "unregComponentFromAll()" -
unregisters given Component from all message types. Complexity is
\f$O(N . log(M))\f$, where \f$N\f$ is number of registered message types
and \f$M\f$ is number of registered Components.


\subsection dev_messaging_impl_assign Message assignement
\ref sim::Sim "Sim" class provides method
\ref sim::Sim::sendMessage "sendMessage()" for sending Messages to
Components. Everytime sendMessage() is called given Message is assigned to
all Components that are currently registered to recieving this type of
message but Message is not delivered immadiatelly. Instead of that all
sent Messages are delivered in batch as soon as possible (in next step).
This is because Messages are usually sent from Components as response for
other Message - it prevents dead lock by ping-ponging of Messages.

\ref sim::SimComponentMessageRegistry "SimComponentMessageRegistry" class
stores Messages directly to Component's member
\ref sim::Component::__msgs_to_deliver "__msgs_to_deliver" and this member
should NOT be touch from within Component class itself, only
SimComponentMessageRegistry can touch it.
\ref sim::Component::__msgs_to_deliver "__msgs_to_deliver"
is two arrays of std::lists:
- Two arrays are used to distinguish between
Messages registered to for current step and Messages registered to next
step.
- Array of std::lists has same length as is number of Messages' priorities.
It is because Messages must be delivered to Components in order of theirs
priorities.
- <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/list">std::list</a> is
used because it has constant time for appending Message.

Type of
\ref sim::Component::__msgs_to_deliver "__msgs_to_deliver"
is thus:
\code
    std::list<const Message *> __msgs_to_deliver[2][Message::PRIO_MAX];
\endcode

\ref sim::SimComponentMessageRegistry "SimComponentMessageRegistry" class
also needs to know which Components have pending Messages to deliver to
prevent iterating over all Components. For this propose is used
\ref sim::SimComponentMessageRegistry "SimComponentMessageRegistry's"
member
\ref sim::SimComponentMessageRegistry::_active "_active" of type:
\code
    std::list<Component *> _active[2][Component::PRIO_MAX][Message::PRIO_MAX];
\endcode
This member holds for every pair of Component priority and Message priority
list of active Components (those that have pending Messages).

Correct filling of previously described variables allow to process messages
as effecient as possible:
- Message can be assigned to Component in constant time. List of Components
registered to this type of Message can be found in \f$O(log(N))\f$ time
(\f$N\f$ - number of message types - see \ref dev_messaging_impl_reg).
- All Components that have pending Messages are stored (and ordered by
priority) in
\ref sim::SimComponentMessageRegistry::_active "_active"
variable in constant time
and the rest of Components (those without any pending Messages) are not
touched at all.

See
\ref sim::SimComponentMessageRegistry::assignMessage "assignMessage"
method.


\subsection dev_messaging_impl_deliver Message delivering
From subsection above should be clear that this operation is very simple a
fast. It is enough to iterate over all active Components stored in
\ref sim::SimComponentMessageRegistry::_active "_active"
member (other Components are untouched!) and call
\ref sim::Component::processMessage "processMessage()"
method on these components with Messages as argument stored in theirs
member
\ref sim::Component::__msgs_to_deliver "__msgs_to_deliver"
member.

It should be clear that number of operations during delivering is one for
each pair of Component-Message that has to be delivered which is _minumum_
possible.

See
\ref sim::SimComponentMessageRegistry::deliverMessages "deliverMessages"
and
\ref sim::SimComponentMessageRegistry::deliverAssignedMessages "deliverAssignedMessages"
methods.
