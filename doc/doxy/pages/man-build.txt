\page man_build How to build sim library

\section man_build_dep Dependencies
First of all you should check you have installed all dependecies.

Makefiles are written to try to find dependencies by itself. Try to
run:
\code $ make check-dep \endcode
It prints out which libraries wasn't found and why. If you are sure you
have installed libraries but Makefile didn't find it (it could happen if
library is not installed in standart paht) you can create Makefile.local
file where can be defined and modified any variables.

You can also try to run:
\code $ make showvars \endcode
It prints all variables and again, if you are not satisfied with values
assigned to variables you can override them by Makefile.local file.

\section man_build_build Building
If you have properly set dependecies library and attached demos can be
build simply by command: \code $ make \endcode
