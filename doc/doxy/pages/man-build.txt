\section man_build_dep Dependencies
First of all you should check you have installed all dependecies.

Makefiles are written to try to find dependencies by itself. Try to
run: \shell{make,check-dep}
It prints out which libraries wasn't found and why. If you are sure you
have installed libraries but Makefile didn't find it (it could happen if
library is not installed in standart path) you can create Makefile.local
file where can be defined and modified any variables.

You can also try to run: \shell{make,showvars}
It prints all variables and again, if you are not satisfied with values
assigned to variables you can override them using Makefile.local file.

sim library currently depends on
\extlink{OpenSceneGraph,www.openscenegraph.org} and \extlink{ODE,www.ode.org}.
Optional dependency is \extlink{SDL,www.libsdl.org} (for joysticks).

Furthemore, it's necessary to have installed either
\extlink{Git,www.git-scm.org} - if you want to download sources from
original git repository - or \extlink{Subversion,subversion.tigris.org} - if
you want to download sources from svn mirror.



\subsection man_build_dep_ubuntu Dependecies on Ubuntu
If you are using \extlink{Ubuntu,www.ubuntu.com} and you don't know how to
install dependecies, here is short guideline.

\extlink{Ubuntu,www.ubuntu.com} has all dependecies in its default
repository. So to install \extlink{OpenSceneGraph,www.openscenegraph.org}
and \extlink{ODE,www.ode.org} simply type in
terminal: \shellsudo{apt-get,install libopenscenegraph-dev libode-dev}

If you want also \extlink{SDL, www.libsdl.org} library install also
libsdl-dev package: \shellsudo{apt-get,install libsdl-dev}

If you are planning to use git repository you will need git:
\shellsudo{apt-get,install git-core}

and if you want to use svn mirror instead you will need Subversion:
\shellsudo{apt-get,install subversion}


\subsection man_build_dep_suse Dependecies on OpenSUSE
On \extlink{OpenSUSE,www.opensuse.org} isn't OpenSceneGraph included in
standart repositories but \extlink{Packman,packman.links2linux.org}
repository is great source of packages OpenSUSE doesn't support by default.
How to add \extlink{Packman,packman.links2linux.org} to list of
repositories see \extlink{wiki,http://wiki.links2linux.de/wiki/PackMan:FAQ_(en)#YaST}.

If you have added \extlink{Packman,packman.links2linux.org} to
repositories, libraries can be installed by single command:
\shellsudo{zypper,install libOpenSceneGraph-devel libode-devel libSDL-devel}

If you will use git repository you need git:
\shellsudo{zypper,install git}
or Subversion if you will use svn mirror:
\shellsudo{zypper,install subversion}



\section man_build_source Source Code
Original source code is versioned in Git repository currently located at
http://git.danfis.cz/sim.git. So you can clone repository by:
\shell{git,clone http://git.danfis.cz/sim.git}

Git repository is also every midnight mirrored to svn repository which you
can checkout by:
\shell{svn,co https://ipvs.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/software/repos/software/Simulation/symbricator-simulation/branches/ctu/sim}

If you want to download a tarball with sources or only check history of
repository you can do that using \extlink{pitweb,pitweb.danfis.cz} web
interface \extlink{here,gitview.danfis.cz/sim}.



\section man_build_build Build
If you have installed all dependecies and downloaded source codes you can
build the library using single command:
\shell{make, }

This will build all static libraries and demos (located in demos/ directory).
